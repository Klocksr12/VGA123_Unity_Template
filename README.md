# VGA123_Unity_Template
 V2
 The majority of this package comes from Unity's Standard assets github, with some modifications by me, to include some simple, extendable scripts for Artists to work with - no code involved. 

You can find their package here, even though you wont need it.

You can also find it in the VGA123_UnityTemplate_V2 folder as README (The Unity version will slowly become updated and instructions found there may become out of date for this project)
