# VGA123_Unity_Template
 V2
 The majority of this package comes from Unity's Standard assets github, with some modifications by me, to include some simple, extendable scripts for Artists to work with - no code involved. 

You can find information about their package here, it is included in this project:
[https://github.com/victorpinto/VGA123_Unity_Template/tree/master/VGA123_UnityTemplate_V2](https://github.com/victorpinto/VGA123_Unity_Template/tree/master/VGA123_UnityTemplate_V2)

## INSTRUCTIONS 
### Scripts: 

**EventTriggers Script** 
The EventTriggers script can do all sorts of things. It functions by checking to see if an object in its "Objects That Trigger" list has interacted with the game object with the EventTriggers script attached. It does this in three key ways 
	

 1. OnTriggerEnter
This one is easy 
 2. OnTriggerStay
 3. OnTrigger Exit
