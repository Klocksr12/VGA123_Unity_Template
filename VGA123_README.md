Most of this template file come from the Unity Github, you can find out plenty more information here [Unity Standard Assets Character Github](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Standard-Assets-Characters) 

The Character Github page includes everything about the character controller minus the event trigger system we will be working with in class. 

This ReadMe will include instructions on how to use the EventTriggers Script for the purpose of triggering animations and the like. 

## EventTriggers Script
### Steps: ###

 1. Create an Empty Game Object as your Event System
 2. Add EventTriggers script to your new EventSystem Game Object
 3. Create Trigger Volume, we will use this trigger to check if the player or pickup object is inside of our trigger 
 4. Drag Trigger Volume Object into the event trigger
